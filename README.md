 <b>Individual Project - Data Analyst</b>
</h1>

Welcome to this project! On this occasion I am taking the roll of a Data Analyst.

-----------------------

Context

We took the role of Data Analyst where one of our clients belongs to the telecommunications industry.

This Argentinian company asked us to carry out a complete study of the sector's behavior, in order to guide them to provide good quality services, identify growth opportunities, and be able to propose customized solutions to their potential clients.

The objective is to increase internet service access by 2% for the next quarter, per 100 households, per province. Additionally, 3 additional KPIs were required to complement the analysis.



Data Exploratory Analysis (DEA)

In order to meet the customer's demand, we conducted a deep analysis of the datasets available on this [link](https://datosabiertos.enacom.gob.ar/dashboards/20000/acceso-a-internet/).

Several analyses were carried out on each one, focusing on 5 of them.


+ We found out the internet access per 100 households is increasing over the years. This is very positive for the goal of 2% set by the client.



+ Over the years, the download speed has been strongly increasing.

+ There is a great difference in download speed between states where Capital Federal has the fastest one with 101mb and Chubut, the slowest with 11mb



Presentation

In order to communicate the results to our client, we chose to do it through the Power BI program, to show trends and behaviors of the variables.
